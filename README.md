## What-I-Unlocked-Today💡

I became the **List Whisperer** today.  
Here’s what I now command like a coding warlock:

- 🦾 Find the **Maximum** value in any list
- 🧊 Hunt down the **Minimum** like a bounty
- ❌ Remove an element like it never existed
- 🔄 Reverse a list like flipping the timeline
- 💣 Watch Java handle memory like a smooth criminal

## Dynamic-Size-Upgrade🧠

Here’s how it *magically grows* when you add too much:

1. Starts with a default size (usually 10)
2. You add more?  
   → It secretly builds a **bigger array**
3. Copies old data into the new one 🧳
4. Adds your new item
5. You don’t even feel it happen.  
   > That’s some Harry Potter meets Iron Man tech 🪄🤖
